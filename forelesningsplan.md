| *Preparation*    |         | We use the open-source programming software R, along with its graphical user interface, RStudio, for all the estimations. We highly recommend you download these onto your personal computer and spend some time acquainting yourself with the RStudio interface. Download R from [here](https://cloud.r-project.org/){:target="blank"}, and RStudio from [here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/){:target="blank"}. Alternatively, you can access R through the Jupyter notebook interface using your web-browser [here](https://jupyter.uit.no){:target="blank"}. Use your UiT username and password.   |
